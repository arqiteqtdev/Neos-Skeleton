## Getting started

- run `nvm use` to get the right node version
- run `npm install` to fetch all the dependencies
- run `npm run start` to start the [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) (`localhost:8080` will be opened automatically)
- start developing
- when you are done, run `npm run build` to get the production version of your app
